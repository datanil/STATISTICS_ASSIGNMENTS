By using inferential statistics, the researcher can analyze the results from the sample to make inferences about how effective the drug is for the entire population of patients with the disease. This allows them to draw conclusions about whether the drug is likely to be effective and safe for a broader group of patients.\n","\n","* *Descriptive statistics provides a summary and understanding of the data at hand, while inferential statistics enables us to make predictions and draw conclusions about a larger population based on sample data.

Using inappropriate statistical methods based on the level of measurement can lead to erroneous conclusions and misinterpretations. Here's an example to illustrate why it's important to consider the level of measurement:\n","\n","**Example:**\n","Suppose we have data on the favorite colors of students in a school.

The calculated mean would be (4 + 3 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 2.5. We might interpret this as the \"average\" favorite color, which doesn't make sense in this context since colors have no inherent numerical value or order. Treating this qualitative data as ratio data leads to incorrect and meaningless results.\n","\n","- **Scenario 2:**\n","> Treating the data as Nominal (Correct approach)\n","If we correctly treat the favorite color data as nominal data, we understand that colors are distinct categories with no inherent order or numerical significance.
