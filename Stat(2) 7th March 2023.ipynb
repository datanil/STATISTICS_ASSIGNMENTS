Since the mean is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the total number of values, outliers can pull the mean towards them, especially if they are significantly larger or smaller than the rest of the data. In the presence of outliers, the mean may not accurately represent the typical value of the dataset.\n","- **Median:**\n","> The median is less influenced by outliers than the mean. It represents the middle value in a dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order. Outliers have no impact on the median as long as they do not affect the position of the middle value. However, if an outlier lies within the middle portion of the dataset, it can shift the median.\n","- **Mode:**\n","> The mode is not affected by outliers because it simply represents the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. Outliers, regardless of their magnitude, do not impact the mode.\n","\n","- ***Example:***\n",">Consider the following dataset representing the ages of a group of people:\n","[25, 28, 29, 26, 30, 23, 27, 26, 24, 29, 70]\n","\n","In this dataset, the value \"70\" is an outlier, as it is significantly larger than the other values. The mean will be heavily affected by this outlier, leading to an inflated average age. The median, however, will remain unaffected as it is the middle value (or average of the two middle values) and \"70\" is not within the middle portion. The mode will also be unaffected, as there are no repeated values except for \"26\" and \"29,\" which are not outliers.\n","\n","2. ***Measures of Dispersion:***\n","- **Range:**\n","> Outliers can significantly affect the range as it is determined by the difference between the largest and smallest values. An outlier with an extreme value can expand the range.\n","- **Variance and Standard Deviation:**\n","> Outliers can inflate the variance and standard deviation as they measure the average squared deviation from the mean. Outliers that are far from the mean contribute more to the variability, resulting in larger variance and standard deviation values.\n","- **Interquartile Range (IQR):**\n","> The IQR, which measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data, is more robust to outliers than the range. It is less influenced by extreme values, providing a more reliable measure of dispersion.\n","\n","- ***Example (continuation of the previous example):***\n",">The range will be heavily influenced by the outlier \"70,\" resulting in a larger range compared to the data without the outlier. Similarly, the variance and standard deviation will be affected, becoming larger due to the impact of the outlier.\n","\n","In summary, outliers can distort the measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion, making it essential to identify and handle them appropriately during data analysis to obtain more accurate and reliable insights."],"metadata":{"id":"cdQVLtjtqXKg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---"],"metadata":{"id":"pT2QzU5eBwmO"}}]}
